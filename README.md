# Hyperparameter optimization

Created for VITMAV45 course as the fourth mid-term assignment.

For this task the hyperas optimizer was used. 

The used model structure and initial parameters were chosen by basic principles and experiences.

Unfortunately, the Colab collapses during the optimization. Therefore, the necessary 100 evaulation was not completed (only 52).
